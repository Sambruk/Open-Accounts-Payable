# Accounts payable as open data

The goal of this project is provide the tools to publish open data about accounts payable (_sv: leverantörsreskontra_)
of Swedish public sector organizations in a unified format.

A standardized way of publishing information about accounts payable as open data. The specification and the data published using it is open and free to use. We hope that this will make it easier to compare purchase patterns and trends primarily within the public sector altho the private sector i free to publish data to.

# Background
The goal of the project was to deliver a standardized way of creating common product specifications primarily for municipalities. Municipalities usually hold part of the national dataset in a given area and common specifications for data are needed in order for reusers to compare between organisations och creating national services.

We achieved this by working with 2 different datasets (accounts payable and municipal health inspections of kitchens) and the experience gained is the basis for the recommended workflow for future similar projects.

The specification was developed as part of a project run by the association Sambruk (link: sambruk.se), a collaboration between about 100 municipalities. The project was (financed)[http://www.vinnova.se/sv/Resultat/Projekt/Effekta/2012-00741/Nationell-definition-av-gemensamma-datamangder-for-oppna-data-i-kommunsamverkan/] by (Vinnova)[http://vinnova.se/], Swedens innovation agency. 

An earlier similar project is another Vinnova-financed one concerning (open meal information)[http://orebrokommun.github.io/Open-Meal-Information/] where the basic workflow was tested for the first time. That project involved only one municipality however and was thus much simpler to run. One conclusion drawn from this project is the importance of involving the stakeholders in the organisations affected by the opening of data. The technique for publishing the specification created worked out well and is being reused for this followup-project to.
