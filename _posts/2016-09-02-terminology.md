The intended target for the technical documentation of this project is software developers. The text does however

this small introduction to the subject.

### Accounts payable

Debts to suppliers. Incoming invoices.


### Ledger of accounts

A list of accounts in bookkeeping. An account represents an asset, a debt, an income or a cost.

A few commonly occuring accounts are:

 *   Bank account (asset)
 *   Personal deposits (debt)
 *   Sale of service (income)
 *   Office supplies (cost)

For a very small company it's usually enough with 20-30 accounts, while a city might have several thousand.

A simplified explanation of accounts is a way to group transactions, e.g. allow one to see how much money is spent
on salaries, for stamps or how much value added tax has been invoiced to customers.

You can read more about available accounts in the Swedish standard [BAS-kontoplanen](http://www.bas.se/kontoplaner.htm),
used by the vast majority of all Swedish organizations.


### Sole trader 

The simplest form of company. A single individual person who has been trusted by the government to keep books and pay
