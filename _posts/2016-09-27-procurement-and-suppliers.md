### Procurement

If everyone publishing information about invoices as open data in the same way the potential for and effects from reuse
are much greater. When in the process of procuring a new system for handling your organisations financials is a good time
to make sure that the new system can deliver open data in accordance with the specification published on this web page. 
The following might be a good demand to make for potential future suppliers:

”The offered solution will supply open data in compliance with the specification published at 
https://sambruk.github.io/Open-Accounts-Payable/.”

### Existing suppliers

Even when you are not in the process of procuring a new system for handling your financials it is a good idéa to ask existing suppliers if they can serve open data according to this specification. We recommend that you send the following questions to them. The more customers that asks the questions the more likely a supplier will be to adopt the specification so you do not need to worry about wether or not the questions have been asked before.

1.  Can your system create open data (electronicaly available for anyone to use without restrictions)?
2.  If not, when will this be possible?
3.  Does/will open data follow the specification detailed at https://sambruk.github.io/Open-Accounts-Payable/? 
4.  If not, why?

The answer to these questions will give you a basis for a constructive dialogue with your supplier.
